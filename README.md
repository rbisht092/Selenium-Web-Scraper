# Selenium-Web-Scraper
This repository contains a web scraper built using Selenium in Python. The scraper collects data from a blog website, extracting information such as blog names, likes, dates, and image URLs. The data is then stored in a CSV file. The code is well-documented and can be easily adapted for similar web scraping projects.
